# Virtual Keyboard

## Overview
The project was originally written by a Russian team and published to Code Project by wingedfox, article link is https://www.codeproject.com/articles/17128/javascript-virtualkeyboard. I slightly refactored the code, fixed a few bugs, completely reorganized project's structure, made it modular, added a jQuery wrapper, and deployed it to the Bower repository.

## Installation
In your project directory run `bower install virtkeys`
